# MPC CFW 2.11.3

MPC software 2.11.3
Force software 3.1.1.3
Ultros / Zangetsu 2021/2022
Control surface doesn't work for MPC Live 2 users in force mode. Known problem, don't care to fix it.
Only tested on MPC-One so far... again use at your own risk.
By now those who are going to use this will know how to use it... instructions shishsmuctions. Figure it out bud.
